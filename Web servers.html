    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Google Chrome</h2>
     <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="google.png" alt="Web Browser and Server Illustration" width="400" /></div>
    <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox.[15] Versions were later released for Linux, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and also for Android, where it is the default browser.[16] The browser is also the main component of ChromeOS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.
       Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium, but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware.[14] WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine;[17] all Chrome variants except iOS used Blink as of 2017.[18]
       As of April 2024, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 65% worldwide browser market share (after peaking at 72.38% in November 2018) on personal computers (PC),[19] is most used on tablets (having surpassed Safari), and is also dominant on smartphones.[20][21] With a market share of 65% across all platforms combined, Chrome is the most used web browser in the world today.[22]
       Google chief executive Eric Schmidt was previously involved in the "browser wars", a part of U.S. corporate history, and opposed the expansion of the company into such a new area. However, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page spearheaded a software demonstration that pushed Schmidt into making Chrome a core business priority, which resulted in commercial success.[23] Because of the proliferation of Chrome, Google has expanded the "Chrome" brand name to other products. These include not just ChromeOS but also Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and Chromebase.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Mozilla Firefox</h2>
     <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="firefox.jpg" alt="Web Browser and Server Illustration" width="400" /></div>
    <p>Mozilla Firefox, or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source[13] web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. It uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.[14] Firefox is available for Windows 10 or later versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including FreeBSD,[15] OpenBSD,[16] NetBSD,[17] and other operating systems, such as ReactOS. Firefox is also available for Android and iOS. However, as with all other iOS web browsers, the iOS version uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko due to platform requirements. An optimized version is also available on the Amazon Fire TV as one of the two main browsers available with Amazon's Silk Browser.[18]
      Firefox is the spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator, as the Mozilla community was created by Netscape in 1998, before its acquisition by AOL.[19] Firefox was created in 2002 under the codename "Phoenix" by members of the Mozilla community who desired a standalone browser rather than the Mozilla Application Suite bundle. During its beta phase, it proved to be popular with its testers and was praised for its speed, security, and add-ons compared to Microsoft's then-dominant Internet Explorer 6. It was released on November 9, 2004,[20] and challenged Internet Explorer's dominance with 60 million downloads within nine months.[21] In November 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name "Quantum" to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.[22]</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Microsoft Edge</h2>
    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="edge.jpg" alt="Web Browser and Server Illustration" width="400" /></div>
    <p>Microsoft Edge is a proprietary cross-platform web browser created by Microsoft and based on the Chromium open-source project, superseding Edge Legacy.[8][9][10] In Windows 11, Edge is the only browser available from Microsoft. However, a bypass is available to open Internet Explorer.
       First made available only for Android and iOS in 2017,[11][12] in late 2018, Microsoft announced it would completely rebuild Edge as a Chromium-based[13][14] browser with Blink and V8 engines, which allowed the browser to be ported from Windows 10 to macOS.[15] The new Edge was publicly released in January 2020,[16][17] and on Xbox as well as Linux[18][19] in 2021.[20][21][22] Edge was also available on Windows 7 and 8/8.1 until early 2023.[23][24]
       In February 2023, according to StatCounter, Microsoft Edge became the third most popular browser in the world, behind Safari and Chrome,[25] while as of January 2025, Edge is second most popular PC/desktop web browser with Safari sliding to 3rd place[26] (including 2nd place in the U.S. or rather there tied with Safari). By 2022, Edge was used by 11% of PCs worldwide.[27]</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Safari</h2>
     <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="safari.jpeg" alt="Web Browser and Server Illustration" width="400" /></div>
    <p>Safari is a web browser developed by Apple. It is built into several of Apple's operating systems, including macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS, and uses Apple's open-source browser engine WebKit, which was derived from KHTML.
       Safari was introduced in an update to Mac OS X Jaguar in January 2003, and made the default web browser with the release of Mac OS X Panther that same year. It has been included with the iPhone since the first-generation iPhone in 2007. At that time, Safari was the fastest browser on the Mac. Between 2007 and 2012, Apple maintained a Windows version,[6][7] but abandoned it due to low market share. In 2010, Safari 5 introduced a reader mode, extensions, and developer tools. Safari 11, released in 2017, added Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which uses artificial intelligence to block web tracking. Safari 13 added support for Apple Pay, and authentication with FIDO2 security keys. Its interface was redesigned in Safari 15, Safari 18, and Safari 26.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Opera</h2>
     <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="opera.png" alt="Web Browser and Server Illustration" width="400" /></div>
    <p>Opera is a multi-platform web browser developed by its namesake company Opera.[11] The current edition of the browser is based on Chromium. Opera is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS (Safari WebKit engine).[12][13] Opera offers two mobile versions, called Opera Mobile[14] and Opera Mini.[15][16]
       Opera was released on 10 April 1995, making it one of the oldest desktop web browsers to exist. It was commercial software for its first ten years and had its own proprietary layout engine, Presto. In 2013, it switched from the Presto engine to Chromium.
       In 2019, Opera introduced Opera GX, a gaming-themed version of Opera with additional features related to gaming.[17] The browser has a feature called mods which made it possible to change the look of the browser with dynamic backgrounds, custom Opera logos, etc.
       In 2025, Opera released Opera Air, a more lightweight version of the browser designed with a focus on mindfulness and user well-being. It integrates standard browsing functionalities with tools aimed at reducing digital stress and enhancing productivity.</p>
